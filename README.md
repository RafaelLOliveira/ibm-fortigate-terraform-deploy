FortiGate IBM Deployment Templates - Currently in Development

## Description

A Terraform script to deploy a single FortiGate in IBM Cloud

## Requirements

-   [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) 0.13+
-   An [IBM Gen 2 API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-provider-reference)
-   FortiOS 6.2.3 //TODO: check version

## Deployment overview

Terraform deploys the following components:

-   A VPC with two subnets
-   A FortiGate BYOL instance with two NICs, one in each subnet
-   A security group with no restrictions

## Deployment

//TODO: once map is introduced deployment will change to also have the fortigate version step.

> **Note:** By default the script expects an ssh key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
> To deploy the FortiDemo Inspector:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change to the cloned directory and initialize the providers and modules:

    ```sh
    $ cd fortidemo-inspector
    $ terraform init
    ```

3. Submit the Terraform plan using the command below. Replace the variables with your own AccessKey and Secret Key.

    ```sh
    $ terraform plan -var "ibmcloud_api_key=<secret_key>"
    ```

4. Verify output.
5. Confirm and apply the plan:

    ```sh
    $ terraform apply -var "ibmcloud_api_key=<secret_key>"
    ```

6. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

## Destroy the cluster

To destroy the cluster, use the command:

```sh
$ terraform destroy -var "ibmcloud_api_key=<secret_key>"
```
